1. Gathering all available information (websites, personell, infrastructure, ... )
    - Maltego is useful here

2. Discovering subdomains and DNS info (DNSDumpster.com, whois, dig, nslookup, host, traceroute, ... )
    - Might look into history DNS data on paid services ( ex.: Censys Search )
    - Reverse search an IP to find DNS with the same IP ( Shared servers )

3. Gathering publicly available information about hosts and IPs (Nmap)
    - Possible to look at Social Media (Possible answers to password recovery questions, emails, ... )
    - Use recon-ng

4. Gathering email addresses (look for patterns, search web for public emails, ... )

5. Locating leaked documents and spreadsheets
    - Using Google Advanced Search or Google Refined Search with specific terms
    - Commands: intitile:"--", filetype:--, site:--, -site:--, inurl:"--"
    - Examples: 
        - intitle:"index of" "nginx.log" (Search for nginx logs, might reveal server misconfiguration)
        - intitle:"index of" "contacts.txt" (Search for juicy information)
        - inurl:/certs/server.key (Might reveal private RSA key)
        - intitle:"index of" "*.php" (PHP file location)
        - intitle:"index of" errors.log (Get error logs)

6. Searching for vulnerabilities (Nmap -sV and metasploit, nikito [loud tool], Nessus, ... )
